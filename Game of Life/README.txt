An early assignment from an intro CS course I was particularly proud of. It is the Game of Life written 
in Python. It starts with four different configurations that the user can choose from by selecting the 
corresponding number and entering it when prompted through the command line. After choosing a starting 
configuration the Game of Life will play out until it finishes (if it finishes, may also run continuously in a looping pattern)
