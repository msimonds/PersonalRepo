The makefile has the two commandline prompts to run the file, I ran out of time to compile a correct Makefile (I'm so sorry). 
The main program takes in three arguments into the MainC.java file that corresponds to <dataset, alg("Id3"), randomseed> like you wanted us to have.

After running the program you can find the output results in "out.txt" in the directory where you ran the program.
C4.5 will run but the results are not how I expected them to be. I go into more detail in the report. 

Thanks!
